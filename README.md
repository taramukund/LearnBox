Virtual reality has the potential to be a very powerful learning tool, and we believe that it will be easier to apply to education, if started early and used with society's youth. Our team has created a Virtual Reality Sandbox environment for younger students who have a visual or physical learning style. 

There's a mother who teaches Kindergarten through 4th grade regularly. Unfortunately due to COVID-19, she has had plenty of struggles keeping students engaged in their education. This is primarily due to the absence of physical interaction from the classroom. His mother has been using educational websites such as "CoolMathGames" to provide an educational experience while keeping her students engaged and entertained.

Our idea is to have a virtual play-space (aka, a Sandbox), which contains a variety of educational-based activities for these younger minds. Activities could range from problem-solving tasks, math problems, or other positive reinforcement tasks such as picking up litter. The purpose is to strengthen positive skills. 

Alongside that, every person (and every child) works differently. Some of us a visual learners, while others are not. This solution would be intended to assist in helping students during COVID times that learn best from visual and/or physical learning styles. 

**Disclaimer, we are acting on the assumption that educational institutions would have VR systems (such as the Oculus Quest) to loan out to students.**
